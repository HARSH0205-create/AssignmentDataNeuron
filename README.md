# Data Neuron Assignent

Description

This project is a full-stack web application that showcases a dynamic and interactive user interface alongside robust backend capabilities. The frontend is built with React and styled with Bootstrap for responsive design. It uses React Grid Layout for creating a draggable and resizable grid of components, adhering to an atomic design structure for high reusability and maintainability of services and components. Form validation is handled gracefully with Formik and Yup, providing a user-friendly experience and ensuring data integrity. The backend is powered by MongoDB as the database, with Express for API development, ensuring smooth data management and server-side logic.
## Features

- Interactive UI: Users can interact with a draggable and resizable grid layout, making the interface adaptable and dynamic.
- Responsive Design: Bootstrap is used for styling, ensuring the application is accessible and visually appealing on various devices.
- Form Validation: Integrates Formik and Yup for efficient, powerful form validation to enhance user experience and ensure data integrity.
- Atomic Design Structure: The project follows an atomic design methodology, breaking down the UI into fundamental blocks for better reusability and maintainability.
- Reusable Services and Components: Emphasizes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by reusing services and components wherever possible.
- MongoDB Database: Utilizes MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Express API: Leverages Express for robust API development, facilitating seamless client-server communication.
